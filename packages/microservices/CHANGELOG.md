## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#14](https://github.com/penna-org/haze/pull/14) [`80169cf`](https://github.com/penna-org/haze/commit/80169cf2ae0ad9159fe1dc50d71a845c6fb91a6b) Thanks [@aibayanyu20](https://github.com/aibayanyu20)! - hazejs 1.0, the first stable release. All `@hazejs/*` packages and `create-hazejs` share version 1.0.0 and follow semantic versioning from here on: breaking changes only land in a new major, with an upgrade guide.
  
  Security fixes included in this release:
  
  - **Rate limiting behind proxies.** With `app.trustProxy`, `ctx.ip` is now the `X-Forwarded-For` entry appended by the nearest trusted proxy (the rightmost) instead of the leftmost one, which the client can set itself; previously a client could get a fresh `throttle` bucket per request by sending its own `X-Forwarded-For`. `trustProxy` also accepts the number of trusted hops (`trustProxy: 2` behind a CDN and a load balancer). The Cloudflare Workers entry passes `cf-connecting-ip` and the AWS Lambda adapter passes the event's `sourceIp` as the client address, so on those platforms `ctx.ip` works without `trustProxy` and `throttle` no longer counts every anonymous request under one shared key. New `setClientAddress(request, ip)` export for custom entries; `throttle` logs a warning once when no client address is known.
  - **Two-factor login lockout.** Wrong codes are counted per user in the cache (new `twoFactor.cacheStore` option, default store) for `challengeTtl`, not in the session cookie the client holds, so replaying the login cookie no longer resets `maxAttempts`. After `maxAttempts` wrong codes the user cannot complete a challenge until `challengeTtl` has passed, even after entering the password again.
  - **Passkey challenges.** In `challenge: 'session'` mode a used challenge is also recorded in the cache, so an old session cookie cannot replay a registration or authentication response.
  
  Packaging: `@hazejs/cli` depends on `@hazejs/vite` with a caret range instead of an exact version, every package has `main` / `types` fallbacks for older module resolution, and `@hazejs/microservices` declares the legacy `nats` client as an optional peer dependency.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`8b3ecb9`](https://github.com/penna-org/haze/commit/8b3ecb968282c5728314d940fb36d8fdc1d2ed94) Thanks [@aibayanyu20](https://github.com/aibayanyu20)! - New optional packages. `@hazejs/graphql`: schema-first and code-first GraphQL on graphql-js, GraphQL over HTTP, subscriptions over `graphql-transport-ws`, request-scoped loaders, depth / complexity limits, auth-aware context and GraphiQL. `@hazejs/microservices`: request/reply and events between services over memory, Redis, NATS and gRPC, with handlers discovered from `app/message` and `haze microservice:listen`.

- [`175e253`](https://github.com/penna-org/haze/commit/175e253f1f42dd5466a7c4409c46b04939bbebce) Thanks [@aibayanyu20](https://github.com/aibayanyu20)! - Unified Redis connections. New `config/redis.ts` (`defineRedisConfig`) declares named connections: a URL or host / port / password / db / TLS, Cluster, Sentinel or a custom client factory, each with an optional `keyPrefix`. Without the file there is one implicit `default` connection reading `REDIS_URL`. The cache `redis` store, the BullMQ queue driver, WebSocket broadcasting, the broadcasting bus, the Socket.IO Redis adapter and the microservices Redis transport accept `connection: '<name>'` (default: the `default` connection), so a single `REDIS_URL` configures all of them; the inline `url` / `options` / `client` forms keep working and take precedence. A shared `RedisManager` opens one command connection per name (kept across hot reloads, closed on shutdown) and dedicated connections for subscribers and blocking commands; BullMQ receives the settings with `keyPrefix` removed and `maxRetriesPerRequest: null`. New `Redis` facade and `useRedis()`, `redisCheck(name)` pings a connection (cache store names still work), and connection names are typed from the generated config. ioredis is loaded through one helper with a single install hint. New projects include `config/redis.ts`, and their cache, queue, WebSocket and Socket.IO configs reference `connection: 'default'`.
